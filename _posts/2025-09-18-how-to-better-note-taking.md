On the general topic of learning new things, one habit that I had was to vigorously note take every word the (online/offline) lecturer is giving me. In this video, the concept of delayed note-taking felt like a really good answer to my anxiety (fear of missing out any information). To me it absolutely reminds me that learning, understanding and retention happens in the brain, not in the note (in which i probably will not open after). Hence, maxxing ways to get it more etched in the mind would have more benefits than having a complete reference note i can refer to later on

The next skill I want to really wrap my head around is mind mapping. A tool my elementary school teachers taught me about, but I just really hated back then, because it makes me just want to doodle and make the most beautiful diagrams instead 😂😭
