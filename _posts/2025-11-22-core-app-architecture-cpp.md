I've been exploring different kinds of C++ project setups. What philosophy do they have, what overarching architecture do they use, what build system do they utilize.

Here, Cherno shares his take on it. He uses Premake (not CMake), and seperates a general Core and App architecture, to later be extendable to more Core components.

Here's another take, the Open Age of Empire (one of my favorite games as a kid), it also has some great docs.

I'm keen to learning more professional and scalable C++ project setups.
