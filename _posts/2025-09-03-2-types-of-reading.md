Lately I've been having a need to learn new things, one of them being Psychology (because I do quite a bit of self dev & team building training for young adults but never learned the formal subject itself), and another is Physics (primer to understand control theory)

I then had this daunting feeling as it feels like such a large task and I probably won't be able to learn them properly. So I've been trying to learn how to learn from different youtube gurus

This video here explains that there are 2 types of reading, to consume and to digest. Me personally a (now not so) proud fast note-taker had always had the urge driven by my anxiety to note down every word. I personally never find this way of learning of effective, but at least it gives me comfort. Now I know that conceptual and process types information are not retained that way, but by mapping, correlating, making critiques, and for process types is best by practicing right away (rings a bell for me when trying a new programming framework)

Many thanks Justin, you make some really great content!
