I'm currently learning how to draw mindmaps for better study outcome. I find this video explaining a lot of my misconceptions on drawing these. Some of them being: I tend to want to make it just beautiful and end up seeing it as an art project instead; I put so much text in it, it simply becomes a linear/list based note, just with lines; I just rewrite the chapter and sub-chapter titles, instead of reflecting my actual thought processes; I see the mind map as the end goal, rather than means of encoding knowledge to my brain;

And from his GRINDE framework, I find that Reflection and Non-Verbal as most valuable to me. My thought processes are wierd, so it might be fun just drawing it down whilst in the process of absorbing/learning, don't need to make it an end goal; Non-verbal meaning less text and more "analogies" and "mnemonics", so delayed learning and more symbols should make me remember them better visually
