I do quite a bit of windows desktop app development, mainly creating libraries for clients to use. I like the notion of the speaker stating that application development and library development can lead to different habits. Using CMake cleanly and with proper SW principles is super essential especially when developing libraries (moreover for OSS). A library dev (and others too) shouldn't see CMake as just another  helper script to compile, but an integral part of the whole system that we r creating. I think giving a good day to the lib user really shouldn't be seen as an afterthought. I personally love using CMakePresets, seamless swtiching between IDEs, CI and builds just feels noice 🙂‍↕️
