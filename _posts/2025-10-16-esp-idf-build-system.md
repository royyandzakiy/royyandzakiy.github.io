Lately I've been going back and forth with zephyr and esp-idf. Something that often times trips me when exploring new frameworks is in understanding their build systems. What goes where, what gets called by what, how to structure things as intended, how can I elevate more with what they have given and make a beautiful (lol) automated and robust build process. I love to fanboy on them gud foldering structures, module seperations, and different build-system task goodness.

This talk by Ivan Grokhotkov really helps to be a primer on most things on what to expect on the esp-idf build system. 

Man, really love these espressif talks, super practical and recent. Really grateful for their effort in these

Here's for further reading on espressifs concept of "components":
