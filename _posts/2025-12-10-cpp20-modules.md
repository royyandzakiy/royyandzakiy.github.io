I've been exploring the "new" features of cpp. here I implemented Modules, a feature in cpp20 that by far can only seamlessly be used in the msvc (Visual Studio 17 2022) compiler if using windows

Github Project: [github.com/royyandzakiy/cpp-modules-example](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/cpp-modules-example)

There are no more header explosion, seperation of includes and src folders, the dreadful circular header includes, or the need to declare functions; which I find very compelling.

Modules still very much allows to use the traditional #include <header>, as long as it gets placed correctly.

I plan to slowly refactor one of my Native Windows Dekstop app to adopt Modules

Here is a good video from CppCon 2023 to learn the basics of it:

Note: per today, I have tried the latest gcc and clang compilers (in windows) and they do not yet support Modules out of the box (need to either prepare the std module, or add compilation options). cmiiw
