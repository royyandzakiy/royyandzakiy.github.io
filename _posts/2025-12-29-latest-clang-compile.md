Just finished my 4 hr compile (with many many times failing) of the llvm-project to get the latest clang++ with custom features 😅 

Compiled it in Linux WSL

Here Mike explained the steps very well through his youtube video "
Build Clang++20 (LLVM 18 and lldb) from source"
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbhGPiGI_Qs)

And the guide in the Clang website is surprisingly good to get started
[LLVM - Getting Started: Building and Running Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)

```cpp
// code will be added here...
```
